;; Make sure the emacs ~ and the .~undo-tree~ files get cleaned up.
;;      this might be solved if i do all my file managment via emacs
;; comment and uncomment block/s-exp via control slash.
;; dont have mode line print if im doing a search though text
;; autosave before quit
;; also, copy, paste, undo, redo, move line up/down one, select all
;; equvalent of atom control shift, insert new line below current one and put cursor on it. dont break current line
;; control-d (or such) to select current word/thing and
;;     control-d while something is selected to also select next occcurence, w/ mutli cursor
;; multiple cursors

;; autocomplete/tab-complete in editor?
;; better scrolling (smooth scrolling didnt work)
;; repl/terminal/etc in emacs
;; scroll up for history (in repl, in echo area maybe, etc)
;; send to terminal?
;; learn org mode
;; better orginize .emacs
;; emacs git integration (git porcelin?)
;;   atom shows what lines are uncommited in git, which is maybe useful. maybe i could toggle to show dif or something
;; better git repo support for emacs configs
;;   (.emacs should just link to ~/emacs/ and ~/emacs/.emacs and ~/emacs/ should be git repo, im guessing)
;; learn/get better find and find/replace (find in folder/repo/etc) (dired? helm?)
;; learn/get better file/project navigation (neotree?) (control-k in atom?)
;;    ?? https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile
;; fuzzy find stuff (helm?)
;; better toggle though buffers and frames. (but mostly frames)
;; tweak timeouts on echo area messages and all that
;; filter some messages (or tweak them) that go in echo area

;; have paste try to indent corrently
;; control-enter should make new line without breaking current line
;; http://emacsredux.com/blog/2013/06/25/boost-performance-by-leveraging-byte-compilation/
;; fuzzy finding for command tab completion (type eval-bufer and tab should make it eval-buffer, or something like that)
;; if i start to type in an argument, up should take me though my history that matches that prefix, like i have in my terminal

;; TODO: control t not finding new files

;; get undo tree mode out of modeline, not needed.
;; maybe get -:@**- thingy out of it too, restly the git branch thing to not say "git"
;; and maybe have file pathname be longer, as to lessen need for treemacs

;; treemacs could have modeline info like neotree does. maybe git branch

;; TODO: get emacsclient and emacs --daemon working with loaded the config files in a smart way
;; and restoring the session. cuts start up time in less than half, which is nice.

these are the current packages i have downloaded:
