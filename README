;; better git repo support for emacs configs

;; TODO: control t not finding new files

;; get undo tree mode out of modeline, not needed.
;; the git branch thing to not say "git"
;; and maybe have file pathname be longer, as to lessen need for treemacs

;; TODO: get emacsclient and emacs --daemon working with loaded the config files in a smart way
;; and restoring the session. cuts start up time in less than half, which is nice.
